OSA Weather Station is started to create an easy open source project for a mixed group. Every one is doing something he's interested in. You can join us once a month on a Wednesday and improve your skills if you want. Interested? [Take a look](https://open-source.academy/about/).

## Goal weatherstation
We started building a weatherstation open source to experience working in a team while doing the part we ourselves like best. The weatherstation tells us the temerature, the pressure and the humidity.
